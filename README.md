# W'xOps — Internal Developer Portal

W'xOps is a self-hosted Internal Developer Portal built around the Golden
Path — one place for developers to onboard, ship, and operate services
without waiting on tickets or juggling a dozen tools.

## What makes it different

- **No database.** Git is the source of truth for the catalog and
  configuration — nothing to patch, back up, or leak.
- **One identity, everywhere.** A single token works for the portal,
  `kubectl`, and CI — no second login, no separate permission system to
  maintain.
- **100% GitOps.** Every change is a reviewable Git PR. The portal never
  writes directly to your cluster.
- **One lightweight binary.** No plugin ecosystem, no Node.js + database
  stack to operate — just a single Go binary with the frontend built in.
- **Runs inside your infrastructure.** Self-hosted by design — your data
  never leaves your environment.
